	<h1>QIIME has been succeeded by <a href="https://qiime2.org">QIIME 2</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>

	<p>As of 1 January 2018, <a href="https://qiime2.org">QIIME 2</a> has succeeded QIIME 1. You can refer to <a href="https://qiime2.org">https://qiime2.org</a> to learn how to install and start using QIIME 2.</p>

	<p>QIIME 1 is no longer officially supported as our development and support efforts are now focused entirely on QIIME 2. You can learn more about this <a href="https://qiime.wordpress.com/2018/01/03/qiime-2-has-succeeded-qiime-1/">here</a>.</p>

	<p>If you're just getting started with QIIME, you should learn <a href="https://qiime2.org">QIIME 2</a>, not QIIME 1. QIIME 1 is outdated and QIIME 2 contains many improvements to analytic functionality, is easier to install, and is easier to use.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

	<p>If you <i>need</i> to use QIIME 1, for example to reproduce old results, <a href="./index-qiime1.html">you can still access the original QIIME 1 website</a>.</p>
