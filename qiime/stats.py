This module provides functionality for the application of various statistical
methods to QIIME-formatted datasets.

The module provides an API that allows users to easily apply any number of
statistical analyses and just as easily retrieve the results. The module also
provides a hierarchy of statistical classes that can be inherited from to
create new statistical method implementations.

    """run paired difference analysis one sample t-tests and generate plots
    
       Apply one-sample t-tests and generate plots to test for changes in
       certain values with a state change. A state change here refers to a 
       pre/post-type experimental design, such as pre-treatment to 
       post-treatment, and the values that are being tested for change can
       be things like alpha diversity, abundance of specific taxa, a principal 
       coordinate value (e.g., PC1 value before and after treatment), and so 
       on. 
       
       The one-sample t-test is applied on each pair of differences. So, if 
       experiment was based on looking for changes in proteobacteria abundance
       with treatment, you would have pre- and post-treatment proteobacteria 
       abundances for a number of individuals. The difference would be computed
       between those, and the null hypothesis is that the mean of those differences
       is equal to zero (i.e., no change with treatment).
       
       Line plots are also generated to show the change on a per-individual basis.
    
     personal_ids_to_state_values: a 2d dictionary mapping personal ids to potential 
      analysis categories, which each contain a pre/post value. this might look like
      the following:
       {'firmicutes-abundance':
            {'subject1':[0.45,0.55],
             'subject2':[0.11,0.52]},
           'bacteroidetes-abundace':
             {'subject1':[0.28,0.21],
              'subject2':[0.11,0.01]}
        }
       examples of functions that can be useful for generating these data are
        qiime.parse.extract_per_individual_state_metadata_from_sample_metadata and
        qiime.parse.extract_per_individual_state_metadata_from_sample_metadata_and_biom
      
     analysis_categories: a list of categories to include in analyses (e.g, 
       ['firmicutes-abundance', 'bacteroidetes-abundace'])
      
     state_values: an ordered list describing each of the states being compared (these
       are the x labels in the resulting plots)
       
     output_dir: directory where output should be written (will be created if 
       it doesn't exist)
       
     ymin: minimum y-value in plots (if it should be consistent across 
       plots - by default will be chosen on a per-plot basis)
       
     ymax: maximum y-value in plots (if it should be consistent across 
       plots - by default will be chosen on a per-plot basis)
