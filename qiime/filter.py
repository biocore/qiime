    Given a category that groups samples by subject (subject_category), samples
    are filtered by how well a subject covers (i.e. has at least one sample
    for) the category states in coverage_category.

    Two filtering criteria are provided (min_num_states and required_states). At
    least one must be provided. If both are provided, the subject must meet
    both criteria to pass the filter (i.e. providing both filters is an AND,
    not an OR, operation).

    A common use case is to provide a 'time' category for coverage_category and
    an 'individual' category for subject_category in order to filter out
    individuals from a study that do not have samples for some minimum number
    of timepoints (min_num_states) and that do not have samples for certain
    timepoints (required_states). For example, this could be the first and last
    timepoints in the study.

    Returns a set of sample IDs to keep, the number of subjects that were
    kept, and a set of the unique category states in coverage_category that
    were kept. The set of sample IDs is not guaranteed to be in any specific
    order relative to the order of sample IDs or subjects in the mapping file.

    Arguments:
        mapping_f - metadata mapping file (file-like object)
        coverage_category - category to test subjects' coverage (string)
        subject_category - category to group samples by subject (string)
        min_num_states - minimum number of category states in coverage_category
            that a subject must cover (i.e. have at least one sample for) to be
            included in results (integer)
        required_states - category states in coverage_category that must be
            covered by a subject's samples in order to be included in results
            (list of strings or items that can be converted to strings)
        considered_states - category states that are counted toward the 
            min_num_states (list of strings or items that can be converted to
            strings)
        splitter_category - category to split input mapping file on prior to
            processing. If not supplied, the mapping file will not be split. If
            supplied, a dictionary mapping splitter_category state to results
            will be returned instead of the three-element tuple. The supplied
            filtering criteria will apply to each split piece of the mapping
            file independently (e.g. if an individual passes the filters for
            the tongue samples, his/her tongue samples will be included for
            the tongue results, even if he/she doesn't pass the filters for the
