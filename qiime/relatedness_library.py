"""The calculations for MPD (mean phylogenetic distance), MNTD (mean nearest
taxon distance), NRI (net relatedness index), and NTI (nearest taxon index) are
based on the formulas available in the Phylocom 4.2 manual and the Webb et al.
2002 paper in Phylogenies and Comunnity Ecology. The manual is 
currently available at http://phylodiversity.net/phylocom/phylocom_manual.pdf,
and the paper is available at 
http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.33.010802.150448.

The null model that is used by the random_mpd and random_mntd methods is null
model 2 (pg 16). Null model 2 specifies that for random draws from the total
phylogeny, any taxa may be taken regardless of whether or not it occurred in 
one of the samples.


Comparisons against phylocom 4.2 shows significant agreement. If you would 
like to test, make the sample file have the folowing form:
clump1    sp1
clump1    sp2
clump1    sp4
clump1    sp7

and the phylo file have the following tree string:
(((sp1:.06,sp2:.1)A:.031,(sp3:.001,sp4:.01)B:.2)AB:.4,((sp5:.03,sp6:.02)C:.13,(sp7:.01,sp8:.005)D:.1)CD:.3)root;
