"""
Library script for creating a bipartite network that connects OTUs to Samples 
and creates files suitable for graphing in Cytoscape. The bipartite graph has 
been utilized for a variety of high profile papers. Usually these graphs have 
shown the connections between samples and OTUs and have been arranged with a 
spring embedded or force directed layout where the edge weights correspond to 
the abundance of the OTU in a given sample. The clustering patterns observed 
have generally corresponded to PCoA clustering patterns.

The original code that performed this function was developed by Julia Goodrich.
It was titled make_otu_network.py and is available in qiime 1.6 and earlier. It
was replaced because changing dependencies and use cases made the old code hard
to use and significantly harder to maintain.

    Metadata can be coded in the biom file in 3 ways, as a string, as a list, 
    or as a dictionary:
    -- as a string -- {'taxonomy':'k__bacteria;p__xyz'}
    -- as a list -- {'taxonomy':['k__bacteria', 'p__xyz']}
    -- as a dictionary -- {'taxonomy':{'kingdom':'bacteria', 'phylum':'xyz'}}
    This function will attempt to divine which type of metadata exists in the
    file. If the metadata is a string, it will be assumed that it is delimited 
    by semicolons. If it is not this function will fail not split it.
    Inputs:
     bt - biom table
     md_key - str, key to access the metadata str/list/dict
     md_fields - list of strs, the fields to pull from if the
     metadata is presented as a dictionary. The md_fields will be the header 
     keys in the output otu_node_table. If metadata is a string or a dict then
     the number of md_fields can differ from the number of available metadata
     entries. This can cause the 
     resulting file to have jagged edges (the header is longer than the metadata
     or vice versa). This does not appear to be a problem with Cytoscape. It may
     cause an error in QIIME though so we apply the same solution as used in 
     summarize_taxa.py The function that takes care of it in that case is called
     sum_counts_by_consensus and it appends 'Other' to the metadata until the
     required length is reached.
