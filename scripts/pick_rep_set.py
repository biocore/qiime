 Additionally, a FASTA file is required, via \"-f\", which contains all of the\
 sequences whose identifiers are listed in the OTU map.  By default, a\
 representative sequence will be chosen as the most abundant sequence in the\

 representative sequences to be the sequences from the reference collection,\
 rather than the sequences from your sequencing run. To achieve this, you can\
 pass the original reference collection via -r. If you additionally allowed for\
 new clusters (i.e., sequences which don't match a reference sequence are used\

 with the representative sequence. The name of the output FASTA file will be\
