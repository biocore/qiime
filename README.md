QIIME: Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology
===================================================

[![Build Status](http://ci.qiime.org/job/QIIME/badge/icon)](http://ci.qiime.org/job/QIIME/)

**[QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org) will succeed QIIME 1 on January 1, 2018. QIIME 1 will no longer be supported at that time**, as development and support effort for QIIME will be focused entirely on QIIME 2.

We recommend that existing QIIME users begin transitioning from QIIME 1 to QIIME 2 now. If you're new to QIIME, you should start by learning QIIME 2, not QIIME 1.

QIIME 1 is now considered to be in maintenance mode as we shift our development efforts to [QIIME 2](http://github.com/qiime2). We don't expect to release any new versions of QIIME 1, except for critical bug fixes if necessary. If you're interested in contributing to QIIME, please consider [contributing to QIIME 2](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
