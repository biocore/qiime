===================
Data Analysis Steps
===================
In this walkthrough, invocation of scripts will be noted with indentation and the $ sign denoting 
the start of a command line. You can find full usage information for each script by passing the -h 
option (help) and/or by reading the full description in the **Documentation**.
First, assemble the sequences (.fna), quality scores (.qual), and metadata mapping file into a 
directory. Execute all tutorial commands from within this directory. 
To access QIIME python scripts, it may be useful to set an environment variable to the location of 
the innermost QIIME directory (the one containing check_id_map.py, for example) ::

	$ qdir=/path/to/QIIME

then further commands of the form ``python QIIMEscript.py -o option`` can be invoked as 
``python $qdir/QIIMEscript.py -o option``.

.. _preprocessing454:

Pre-processing 454 Data
-----------------------
Filter the reads based on quality, and assign multiplexed reads to starting sample by nucleotide 
barcode.

.. _checkmapping:

Check Mapping File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before beginning the pipeline, you should ensure that your mapping file is formatted correctly with
the check_map_id.py script. ::

	$ python $qdir/check_id_map.py -m Fasting_Map.txt -o mapping_output/

If verbose (-v) is enabled, this utility will print to STDOUT a message indicating whether or not 
problems were found in the mapping file. Errors and warnings will the output to a log file, which 
will be present in the specified (-o) output directory. Errors will cause fatal problems with 
subsequent scripts and must be corrected before moving forward. Warnings will not cause fatal 
problems, but it is encouraged that you fix these problems as they are often indicative of typos 
in your mapping file, invalid characters, or other unintended errors that will impact downstream 
analysis. A corrected_mapping.txt file will also be created in the output directory, which will 
have a copy of the mapping file with invalid characters replaced by underscores, or a message 
indicating that no invalid characters were found.

.. _assignsamples:

Assign Samples to Mulitplex Reads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The next task is to assign the mulitplex reads to samples based on their nucleotide barcode. Also, 
this step performs quality filtering based on the characteristics of each sequence, removing any 
low quality or ambiguous reads. The script for this step is ``split_libraries.py``. A full 
description of parameters for this script are described in the **Documentation**. For this 
tutorial, we will use default parameters (minimum quality score = 25, minimum/maximum length = 
200/1000, no ambiguous bases allowed and no mismatches allowed in the primer sequence).::

	$ python $qdir/split_libraries.py -m Fasting_Map.txt -f Fasting_Example.fna 
	-q Fasting_Example.qual -o Fasting_Split_Lib_Out

This invocation will create three files in the new directory ``Fasting_Split_Lib_Out``:

* ``split_library_log.txt`` : This file contains the summary of splitting, including the number of reads detected for each sample and a brief summary of any reads that were removed due to quality considerations.
* ``histograms.txt`` : This tab delimited file shows the number of reads at regular size intervals before and after splitting the library.
* ``seqs.fna`` : This is a fasta formatted file where each sequence is renamed according to the sample it came from. The header line also contains the name of the read in the input fasta file and information on any barcode errors that were corrected.

A few lines from the "seqs.fna" file are shown below ::

	>PC.634_1 FLP3FBN01ELBSX orig_bc=ACAGAGTCGGCT new_bc=ACAGAGTCGGCT bc_diffs=0

.. _pickotusandrepseqs:

Pick Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and Representative Sequences
--------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _pickotusseqsim:

Pick OTUs based on Sequence Similarity within the Reads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At this step, all of the sequences from all of the samples will be clustered into Operational 
Taxonomic Units (OTUs) based on their sequence similarity. OTUs in QIIME are clusters of sequences,
frequently intended to represent some degree of taxonomic relatedness. For example, when sequences
are clustered at 97% sequence similarity with cd-hit, each resulting cluster is typically thought 
of as representing a genus. This model and the current techniques for picking OTUs are known to be 
flawed, and determining exactly how OTUs should be defined, and what they represent, is an active 
area of research. Thus, OTU-picking will identify highly similar sequences across the samples and 
provide a platform for comparisons of community structure. The script ``pick_otus.py`` takes as 
input the fasta file output from :ref:`assignsamples` above, and returns a list of OTUs detected 
and the fasta header for sequences that belong in that OTU. To invoke the script using cd-hit to 
cluster and the default setting of 96% similarity determining an OTU, use ::

	$ python $qdir/pick_otus.py -i Fasting_Split_Lib_Out/seqs.fna -m cdhit -o Fasting_picked_otus

In the newly created directory ``Fasting_picked_otus``, there will be two files. One is 
``seqs.log``, which contains information about the invocation of the script. The OTUs will be 
recorded in the tab-delimited file ``seqs_otus.txt``. The OTUs are arbitrarily named by a number, 
which is recorded in the first column. The subsequent columns in each line identify the sequence or
sequences that belong in that OTU.

.. _pickrepseqsforotu:

Pick Representative Sequences for each OTU
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Since each OTU may be made up of many sequences, we will pick a representative sequence for that 
OTU for downstream analysis. This representative sequence will be used for taxonomic identification
of the OTU and phylogenetic alignment. The script ``pick_rep_set.py`` uses the otu file created 
above and extracts a representative sequence from the fasta file by one of several methods. To use 
the default method, where the most abundant sequence in the OTU is used as the representative 
sequence, invoke the script as follows ::

	$ python $qdir/pick_rep_set.py -i Fasting_picked_otus/seqs_otus.txt 
	-f Fasting_Split_Lib_Out/seqs.fna -l Fasting_picked_otus/rep_set.log 
	-o Fasting_picked_otus/rep_set.fa

In the directory "Fasting_picked_otus", the script has created two new files - the log file 
``rep_set.log`` and the fasta file ``rep_set.fa`` containing one representative sequence for each 
OTU. In this fasta file, the sequence has been renamed by the OTU, and the additional information 
on the header line reflects the sequence used as the representative ::

	>0 PC.636_424
	CTGGGCCGTATCTCAGTCCCAATGTGGCCGGTCGACCTCTC....
	>1 PC.481_321
	TTGGGCCGTGTCTCAGTCCCAATGTGGCCGTCCGCCCTCTC....

.. _assigntaxotuanalysis:

Assign Taxonomy and Perform OTU Table Analyses
----------------------------------------------
In this section, we will assign the representative sequences for each OTU to a taxonomic identity 
using reference databases, and make an OTU table. Once the OTU table is generated, we show some 
ways to visualize the table.

.. _assigntax:

Assign Taxonomy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A primary goal of the QIIME pipeline is to assign high-throughput sequencing reads to taxonomic 
identities using established databases. This will give you information on the microbial lineages 
found in your samples. Using ``assign_taxonomy.py``, you can compare your OTUs against a reference 
database of your choosing. For our example, we will use the RDP classification system.::

	$ python $qdir/assign_taxonomy.py -i Fasting_picked_otus/rep_set.fa 
	-m rdp -o Fasting_rdp_taxonomy

In the directory "Fasting_rdp_taxonomy", there will be a log file and a text file. The text file 
contains a line for each OTU considered, with the RDP taxonomy assignment and a numerical 
confidence of that assignment (1 is the highest possible confidence). For some OTUs, the assignment
will be as specific as a bacterial species, while others may be assignable to nothing more 
specific than the bacterial domain. Below are the first few lines of the text file and the user 
should note that the taxonomic assignment and confidence numbers from their run may not coincide 
with the output shown below, due to the RDP classification algorithm ::

	41	PC.356_347	Root;Bacteria									0.980
	63	PC.635_130	Root;Bacteria;Firmicutes;"Clostridia";Clostridiales;"Lachnospiraceae"		0.960
	353	PC.634_150	Root;Bacteria;Proteobacteria;Deltaproteobacteria				0.880
	18	PC.355_1011	Root;Bacteria;Bacteroidetes;Bacteroidetes;Bacteroidales;Rikenellaceae;Alistipes	0.990

.. _makeotutable:

Make OTU Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using these assignments and the OTU file created in :ref:`pickotusseqsim`, we can make a readable 
matrix of OTU by Sample with meaningful taxonomic identifiers for each OTU. The script is 
``make_otu_table.py``.::

	$ python $qdir/make_otu_table.py -i Fasting_picked_otus/seqs_otus.txt -t
	Fasting_rdp_taxonomy/rep_set_tax_assignments.txt -o Fasting_otu_table.txt

The first few lines of ``Fasting_otu_table.txt`` are shown below (OTUs 2-9), where the first column
contains the OTU number, the last column contains the taxonomic assignment for the OTU, and 9 
columns between are for each of our 9 samples. The value of each *ij* entry in the matrix is the 
number of times OTU *i* was found in the sequences for sample *j*. ::

	#Full OTU Counts
	#OTUID	PC.354	PC.355	PC.356	PC.481	PC.593	PC.607	PC.634	PC.635	PC.636	Consensus	Lineage

.. _rareotutableremovehetero:

Rarify OTU Table to Remove Sample Heterogeneity (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To remove sample heterogeneity, we can perform rarefaction on our OTU table. Rarefaction is an 
ecological approach that allows users to standardize the data obtained from samples with different 
sequencing efforts, and to compare the OTU richness of the samples using this standardized 
platform. For instance, if one of your samples yielded 10,000 sequence counts, and another yielded 
only 1,000 counts, the species diversity within those samples may be much more influenced by 
sequencing effort than underlying biology. The approach of rarefaction is to randomly sample the 
same number of OTUs from each sample, and use this data to compare the communities at a given level
of sampling effort.

To perform rarefaction, you need to set the boundaries for sampling and the step size between 
sampling intervals. You can find the number of sequences associated with each sample by looking at 
the last line of the ``split_library_log.txt`` file generated in :ref:`assignsamples` above. The 
line from our tutorial is pasted here::

	Sample ct min/max/mean: 146 / 150 / 148.11

Since we are only removing sample heterogeniety from the OTU table, we will set the upper and lower
boundaries to be equal, with a single step size and only one iteration. Rarefaction is most useful
when most samples have the specified number of sequences, so your upper bound of rarefaction 
should be close to the minimum number of sequences found in a sample. For this case, we will set 
the min/max to 146. ::

	$ python $qdir/rarefaction.py -i Fasting_otu_table.txt -m 146 -x 146 -s 1 
	-n 1 -o Fasting_Rarified_Otu_Table/

The newly created directory "Fasting_Rarified_Otu_Table" will contain a single text file named 
``rarefaction_146_0.txt``. For all subsequent analyses, one can use this text file in place of 
``Fasting_otu_table.txt``, since this file is also an OTU table, except that it has been rarified.

.. _makeheatmap:

Make OTU Heatmap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The QIIME pipeline includes a very useful utility to generate images of the OTU table. The script 
is ``make_otu_heatmap_html.py`` ::

	$ python $qdir/make_otu_heatmap_html.py -i Fasting_otu_table.txt -o Fasting_OTU_Heatmap/

An html file is created in the directory "Fasting_OTU_Heatmap". You can open this file with any 
web browser, and will be prompted to enter a value for "Filter by Counts per OTU". Only OTUs with 
total counts at or above this threshold will be displayed. Click the "Sample ID" button, and a 
graphic will be generated like the figure below. For each sample, you will see in a heatmap the 
number of times each OTU was found in that sample. You can mouse over any individual count to get 
more information on the OTU (including taxonomic assignment). Within the mouseover, there is a 
link for the terminal lineage assignment, so you can easily search Google for more information 
about that assignment.

.. image:: heatmap.png
   :align: center

Alternatively, you can click on one of the counts in the heatmap and a new pop-up window will 
appear.  The pop-up window uses a Google Visualization API called Magic-Table.  Depending on which table count you clicked on, the pop-up window will put the clicked-on count in the middle of the pop-up heatmap as shown below.  For the following example, the table count with the red arrow mouseover is the same one being focused on using the Magic-Table.

.. image:: fisheyeheatmap.png
   :align: center

On the original heatmap webpage, if you select the "Taxonomy" button instead, you will generate a 
heatmap keyed by taxon assignment, which allows you to conveniently look for organisms and lineages
of interest in your study.  Again, mousing over an individual count will show additional 
information for that OTU and sample.

.. image:: taxheatmap.png
   :align: center

.. _makeotunetwork:

Make OTU Network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An alternative to viewing the OTU table as a heatmap, is to create an OTU network, using the 
following command.::

	$ python $qdir/make_otu_network.py -i Fasting_Map.txt -c Fasting_otu_table.txt 
	-o OTU_Network

To visualize the network, we use the Cytoscape_ program, where each red circle represents a sample 
and each white square represents an otu.  The lines represent the OTUs present in a particular 
sample (blue for controls and green for fasting).  For more information about opening the files 
in Cytoscape_ please refer to **Documentation**.

.. image:: network.png
   :align: center

You can group OTUs by different taxonomic levels (division, class, family) with the script 
summarize_taxa.py. The input is the OTU table created above and the taxonomic level you need to 
group the OTUs. For the RDP taxonomy, the following taxonomic levels correspond to: 2 = Domain 
(Bacteria), 3 = Phylum (Actinobacteria), 4 = Class, and so on. ::

	$ python $qdir/summarize_taxa.py -O Fasting_otu_table.txt 
	-o Fasting_otu_table_Level3.txt -L 3 -r 0 

The script will generate a new OTU table ``Fasting_otu_table_Level3.txt``, where the value of 
each *ij* entry in the matrix is the count of the number of times all OTUs belonging to the 
taxon *i* (for example, Phylum Actinobacteria) were found in the sequences for sample *j*. ::

	#Full OTU Counts
	Taxon				PC.354 PC.355 	PC.356 	PC.481 	PC.593 	PC.607 	PC.634 	PC.635 	PC.636

.. _makepiecharts:

Make Pie Charts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To visualize the summarized taxa, you can use the ``make_pie_charts.py`` script, which shows which 
taxons are present in all samples or within each sample (-s). ::

	$ python $qdir/make_pie_charts.py -i Fasting_otu_table_Level3.txt 
	-l Phylum -o Fasting_Pie_Charts -s

To view the resulting pie charts, open the html file located in the "Fasting_Pie_Charts" folder. 
The following pie chart shows the taxa assignments for all samples.

The following pie chart shows the taxa assignments for one of the samples (PC.354).

.. _alignotuseqsfilteralngentree:

Align OTU Sequences, Filter the Alignment and Generate a Phylogenetic Tree
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _alignotuseq:

Align OTU Sequences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Alignment of the sequences and phylogeny inference is necessary only if phylogenetic tools such as 
UniFrac_ will be subsequently invoked.  Alignments can either be generated de novo using programs 
such as MUSCLE, or through assignment to an existing alignment with tools like PyNAST_.  For small 
studies such as this tutorial, either method is possible.  However, for studies involving many 
sequences (roughly, more than 1000), the de novo aligners are very slow and assignment with 
PyNAST_ is preferred.  Either alignment approach is accomplished with the script ``align_seqs.py``.
Since this is one of the most computationally intensive bottlenecks in the pipeline, large 
studies would benefit greatly from parallelization of this task (described in detail in the 
**Documentation**) ::

	$ python $qdir/align_seqs.py -i Fasting_picked_otus/rep_set.fa -o Default_Aln 
	-t /path/to/Green_genes_core_set/core_set_aligned.fasta.imputed -e 150 

A log file and an alignment file are created in the directory "Default_Aln".

.. _filteraln:

Filter Alignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before building the tree, one must filter the alignment to removed columns comprised of only 
gaps. ::

	$ python $qdir/filter_alignment.py -m /path/to/Green_genes_core_set/lanemask_in_1s_and_0s.txt 
	-i Default_Aln/rep_set_aligned.fa -o Filtered_Aln

.. _maketree:

Make Phylogenetic Tree
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The filtered alignment file produced in the directory "Filtered_Aln" can be used to build a 
phylogenetic tree using a tree-building program.  Here is an example of how to create a tree 
with the program FastTree and the script ``make_phylogeny.py``::

	$ python $qdir/make_phylogeny.py -t fasttree -o Filtered_Aln/rep_set_aligned.tre 
	-l Filtered_Aln/rep_set_tree.log -i Filtered_Aln/rep_set_aligned_pfiltered.fasta

The Newick format tree file is written to "Filtered_Aln/rep_set_aligned.tre".  This file can be 
used in tree visualization software, and is necessary for UniFrac_ diversity measurements 
(described below).  For the following example the FigTree program was used to visualize the 
phylogenetic tree obtained from ``rep_set_aligned.tre``.

.. image:: tree.png

.. _compalphadivrarecurves:

Compute Alpha Diversity within the Samples, and Generate Rarefaction Curves
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Community ecologists typically describe the microbial diversity within their study.  This diversity
can be assessed within a sample (alpha diversity) or between a collection of samples 
(beta diversity).  Here, we will determine the level of alpha diversity in our samples using a 
series of scripts from the QIIME pipeline.

.. _rareotutable:

Rarify OTU Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For this highly artificial example, all of the samples had sequence counts between 146 and 150, as 
discussed in :ref:`rareotutableremovehetero`. In real datasets, the range will generally be much 
larger.  In practice, rarefaction is most useful when most samples have the specified number of 
sequences, so your upper bound of rarefaction should be close to the minimum number of sequences 
found in a sample.  This is a judgment call, and the rarefaction can be repeated until satisfactory
information is attained.  We will use an upper bound (rarefaction maximum, option -x) of 141 
sequences, a lower bound (minimum, option -m) of 1, and a step size of 10 (option -s).  We want 
enough steps to create smooth curves, but not so many as to create a computational bottleneck.  
Finally, we will choose to do 5 iterations (option -n); higher numbers of iterations will give you 
greater confidence that the average result of the random sampling is representative, but will also 
increase the compute time. ::

	$ python $qdir/rarefaction.py -i Fasting_otu_table.txt -m 1 -x 141 -s 10 
	-n 5 -o Fasting_Rarefaction/ 

The newly created directory "Fasting_Rarefaction" will contain many text files named 
``rarefaction_##_#.txt`` ; the first set of numbers represents the number of sequences sampled, 
and the last number represents the iteration number.  If you opened one of these files, you would 
find an otu table where for each sample the sum of the counts equals the number of samples taken.

.. _computealphadiv:

Compute Alpha Diversity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The rarefaction tables are the basis for calculating diversity metrics, which reflect the diversity
within the sample based on taxon counts of phylogeny.  The QIIME pipeline allows users to 
conveniently calculate more than two dozen different diversity metrics.  The full list of available
metrics is available by passing the option -s to the script alpha_diversity.py.  Every metric has
different strengths and limitations - technical discussion of each metric is readily available 
online and in ecology textbooks, but it is beyond the scope of this document.  Here, we will 
calculate three metrics: 

#. `The Simpson Index <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson_index>` is a very common measure of 
species abundance based on OTU counts
#. The Observed Species metric is simply the count of unique OTUs found in the sample
#. Phylogenetic Distance (PD_whole_tree) is the only phylogenetic metric used in this script and 
requires a phylogenetic tree as an input. ::  

	$ python $qdir/alpha_diversity.py -i Fasting_Rarefaction/ -o Fasting_Alpha_Metrics/ 
	-m simpson,PD_whole_tree,observed_species -t Filtered_Aln/rep_set_aligned.tre 

.. _collateotutable:

Collate Rarified OTU Tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The output directory "Fasting_Alpha_Metric/" will contain one text file ``alpha_rarefaction_##_#`` 
for every file input from ″Fasting_Rarefaction/″, where the numbers repesent the number of samples 
and iterations as before.  The content of this tab delimited file is the calculated metrics for 
each sample.  To collapse the individual files into a single combined table, use the script 
``collate_alpha.py``::

	$ python $qdir/collate_alpha.py -i Fasting_Alpha_Metrics/ -o Fasting_Alpha_Collated/ 

In the newly created directory "Fasting_Alpha_Collated", there will be one matrix for every 
diversity metric used in the ``alpha_diversity.py`` script.  This matrix will contain the metric 
for every sample, arranged in ascending order from lowest number of sequences per sample to 
highest.  A portion of the ``observed_species.txt`` file are shown below::

	Sequences per sample	iteration	PC.354	PC.355	PC.356	PC.481	PC.593	 
	alpha_rarefaction_21_0.txt	21			0		14.0	16.0	18.0	18.0	13.0	
	alpha_rarefaction_21_1.txt	21			1		15.0	17.0	18.0	20.0	12.0	
	alpha_rarefaction_21_2.txt	21			2		15.0	16.0	21.0	19.0	13.0	
	alpha_rarefaction_21_3.txt	21			3		10.0	19.0	18.0	21.0	13.0
	alpha_rarefaction_21_4.txt	21			4		14.0	18.0	16.0	15.0	12.0		
	......

.. _generaterarecurves:

Generate Rarefaction Curves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The script ``make_rarefaction_plots.py`` takes a mapping file and any number of rarefaction files 
generated by ``collate_alpha.py`` and uses matplotlib to create rarefaction curves. Each curve 
represents a sample and can be colored by the sample metadata supplied in the mapping file.  For 
this study, we will use the PD_whole_tree results and color by the Treatment Category. ::

	$ python $qdir/make_rarefaction_plots.py -m Fasting_Map.txt 
	-r Fasting_Alpha_Collated/PD_whole_tree.txt -o Rarefaction_Plots -p Treatment -i png

To view the rarefaction plot navigate to the bottom-level file within the "rarefaction_graph##" 
folder, where you will find a png file titled "Treatment.png".  This plot shows the averages of 
each value for in the Treatment category with their corresponding error bars.

.. _compbetadivgenpcoa:

Compute Beta Diversity and Generate 2D/3D Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) Plots
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _compbetadiv:

Compute Beta Diversity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Beta-diversity metrics assess the differences between microbial communities.  In general, 
these metrics are calculated to study diversity along an environmental gradient (pH or temperature) 
or different disease states (lean vs. obese).  The basic output of this comparison is a square 
matrix where a "distance" is calculated between every pair of samples reflecting the similarity 
between the samples.  The data in this distance matrix can be visualized with clustering analyses, 
namely Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical clustering (UPGMA).  Like alpha 
diversity, there are many possible metrics which can be calculated with the QIIME pipeline - the 
full list of options can be seen by passing option -s to the script ``beta_diversity.py``.  For our 
example, we will calculate the unweighted unifrac metric, which is a phylogenetic measure used 
extensively in recent microbial community sequencing projects. ::

	$ python $qdir/beta_diversity.py -i Fasting_otu_table.txt -m unweighted_unifrac 
	-o unifrac_dist -t Filtered_Aln/rep_set_aligned.tre 

The resulting distance matrix (unifrac_dist/unweighted_unifrac_Fasting_otu_table.txt ) is the 
basis for two methods of visualization and sample comparison: PCoA and UPGMA.  

.. _gendisthist:

Generate Distance Histograms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Distance Histograms are a way to compare different categories and see which tend to have 
larger/smaller distances than others.  For example, in the hand study, you may want to compare 
the distances between hands to the distances between individuals. ::

	$ python $qdir/make_distance_histograms.py 
	-d unifrac_dist/unweighted_unifrac_Fasting_otu_table.txt -m Fasting_Map.txt 
	--fields Treatment -o Distance_Histograms --html_output

For each of these groups of distances a histogram is made.  The output is a HTML file 
("QIIME_Distance_Histograms.html") where you can look at all the distance histograms individually, 
and compare them between each other. Within the webpage, the user can mouseover and/or select the 
checkboxes in the right panel to turn on/off the different distances within/between categories.  
For this example, we are comparing the distances between the samples in the Control versus 
themselves, along with samples from Fasting versus the Control.

Generate Principal Coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) is a technique that helps to extract and visualize a few 
highly informative gradients of variation from complex, multidimensional data.  This is a complex 
transformation that maps the distance matrix to a new set of orthogonol axes such that a maximum 
amount of variation is explained by the first principal coordinate, the second largest amount of 
variation is explained by the second principal coordinate, etc.  The principal coordinates can be 
plotted in two or three dimensions to provide an intuitive visualization of the data structure and 
look at differences between the samples, and look for similiarities by sample category.  The 
transformation is accomplished with the script ``principal_coordinates.py``::

	$ python $qdir/principal_coordinates.py 
	-i unifrac_dist/unweighted_unifrac_Fasting_otu_table.txt -o Fasting_Unw_Unifrac_coords.txt 

The file "Fasting_Unw_Unifrac_coords.txt" lists every sample in the first column, and the 
subsequent columns contain the value for the sample against the noted principal coordinate.  
At the bottom of each Principal Coordinate column, you will find the eigenvalue and percent of 
variation explained by the coordinate.  To determine which axes are useful for your project, you 
can generate a "scree plot" by plotting the eigenvalues of each principal component in descending 
order

.. _gen2d3dpcoa:

Generate 2D and 3D PCoA Plots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To plot the coordinates, you can use the QIIME scripts ``make_2d_plots.py`` and ``make_3d_plots.py``.  
The two dimensional plot will be rendered as a html file which can be opened with a standard web 
browser, while the three dimensional plot will be a kinemage file which requires additional 
software to render and manipulate.  The usage for both scripts use the same convention, detailed 
in the **Documentation**. ::

	$ python $qdir/make_2d_plots.py -i Fasting_Unw_Unifrac_coords.txt -m Fasting_Map.txt 
	-o Fasting_2d/ -b Treatment
	
	$ python $qdir/make_3d_plots.py -i Fasting_Unw_unifrac_coords.txt -m Fasting_Map.txt 
	-o Fasting_3d/ -b "DOB,Treatment"

The html file created in directory "Fasting_2d/" shows a plot for each combination of the first 
three principal coorindates.  Since we specified Treatment to use for coloring the samples, each 
sample colored according to the category it corresponds. You can get the name for each sample by 
holding your mouse over the data point.  

.. image:: pcoa1.png
   :align: center

In the invocation of ``make_3d_plot.py``, we specified that the samples should be colored by the 
value of the "Treament" and  "DOB" columns in the mapping file. For the "Treatment" column, all 
samples with the same "Treatment" will get the same color.  For our tutorial, the five control 
samples are all blue and the four control samples are all green.  This lets you easily visualize 
"clustering" by metadata category.  The 3d visualization software allows you to rotate the axes 
to see the data from different perspectives.  By default, the script will plot the first three 
dimensions in your file. Other combinations can be viewed using the "Views:Choose viewing axes" 
option in the KiNG viewer (may require the installation of kinemage software). The first 10 
components can be viewed using "Views:Paralled coordinates" option or typing "/".

Hierarchical Clustering and Jackknifing Support
-----------------------------------------------

.. _hiarchclust:

Hierarchical Clustering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) is type of hierarchical clustering 
method using average linkage and can be used to visualize the distance matrix produced by 
``beta_diversity.py``. The output is a file that can be opened with tree viewing software, such as 
FigTree. ::

	$ python $qdir/hierarchical_cluster.py 
	-i unifrac_dist/unweighted_unifrac_Fasting_otu_table.txt -o Fasting_Unw_Unifrac_upgma.tre

.. image:: hiarchclust.png
   :align: center

This tree shows the relationship among the 9 samples, and reveals that the 4 samples from the guts 
of fasting mice cluster together (PC.6xx, fasting data is in ``Fasting_Map.txt``).  

.. _jacksupport:

Perform Jackknifing Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To measure the robustness of this result to sequencing effort, we perform a jackknifing analysis, 
wherein a smaller number of sequences are chosen at random from each sample, and the resulting 
UPGMA tree from this subset of data is compared with the tree representing the entire available 
data set.  This process is repeated with many random subsets of data, and the tree nodes which 
prove more consistent across jackknifed datasets are deemed more robust.

First the jackknifed otu tables must be generated, by subsampling the full available data set.  
In this tutorial, each sample contains between 146 and 150 sequences, as shown in the 
``split_library_log.txt`` file::

	Sample ct min/max/mean: 146 / 150 / 148.11

To ensure that a random subset of sequences is selected from each sample, we chose to select 110 
sequences from each sample (75% of the smallest sample, though this value is only a guideline).  
We use ``rarefaction.py``, which has already been described::

	$ python $qdir/rarefaction.py -i Fasting_otu_table.txt -m 110 -x 110 -s 1 -n 20 
	-o jackknife_otu/ --small_included

This generates 20 subsets of the available data by random sampling, simulating a smaller sampling 
effort (110 sequences in each sample).  Because our goal is to compare these jackknifed trees to 
the tree already generated, we use --small_included to ensure that every sample present in the 
original tree is present in the jackknifed ones.  (here --small_included isn't actually necessary, 
as all samples have > 110 sequences).

We then calculate the distance matrix for each jackknifed dataset, using ``beta_diversity.py`` as 
before, but now in batch mode::

	$ python $qdir/beta_diversity.py -i jackknife_otu -m dist_unweighted_unifrac 
	-t Filtered_Aln/rep_set_aligned.tre -o jackknife_dist

which results in 20 distance matrix files written to the "jackknife_dist directory".  Each of those 
is then used as the basis for hierarchical clustering, using ``hierarchical_cluster.py`` in batch 
mode::

	$ python $qdir/hierarchical_cluster.py -i jackknife_dist -o jackknife_upgma

.. _compjackclustertree:

Compare Jackknifed Trees to Cluster Tree
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hierarchical clustering of the 20 distance matrix files results in 20 UPGMA samples clusters, each 
based on a random sub-sample of the available sequence data.  These are then compared to the 
UPGMA result using all available data::

	$ python $qdir/tree_compare.py -m Fasting_Unw_Unifrac_upgma.tre -s jackknife_upgma 
	-o Fasting_jackknife_support

This compares the UPGMA clustering based on all available data (-m) with the jackknifed UPGMA 
results (-s).  Two files are written to "Fasting_jackknife_support":

* master_tree.tre is virtually identical to "Fasting_Unw_Unifrac_upgma.tre", but each internal node of the UPGMA clustering is assigned a unique name
* jackknife_support.txt explains how frequently a given internal node had the same set of descendant samples in the jackknifed UPGMA clusters as it does in the UPGMA cluster using the full available data.  A value of 0.5 indicates that half of the jackknifed data sets support that node, while 1.0 indicates perfect support.

.. _genboottree:

Generate Bootstrapped Tree
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This data can be visualized using ``make_bootstrapped_tree.py``::

	$ python $qdir/make_bootstrapped_tree.py -m Fasting_jackknife_support/master_tree.tre 
	-s Fasting_jackknife_support/jackknife_support.txt 
	-o Fasting_jackknife_support/Unw_unifrac_support.pdf

The resulting pdf shows the tree with internal nodes colored, red for 75-100% support, yellow for 
50-75%, green for 25-50%, and blue for < 25% support.  Although UPGMA shows that PC.354 and 
PC.593 cluster together and PC.481 with PC.6xx cluster together, we can not have high confidence 
in that result.  However, there is excellent jackknife support for all fasted samples (PC.6xx) 
which are clustering together, separate from the non-fasted (PC.35x) samples.
