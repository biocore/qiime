*make_2d_plots.py* -- Make 2D PCoA Plots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description:**

This script generates 2D PCoA plots using the principal coordinates file generated by performing beta diversity measures of an OTU table.


**Usage:** :file:`make_2d_plots.py [options]`

**Input Arguments:**

.. note::

	
	**[REQUIRED]**
		
	-i, `-`-coord_fname
		This is the path to the principal coordinates file (i.e., resulting file from `principal_coordinates.py <./principal_coordinates.html>`_)
	
	**[OPTIONAL]**
		
	-m, `-`-map_fname
		This is the metadata mapping file [default=None]
	-b, `-`-colorby
		This is the categories to color by in the plots from the user-generated mapping file. The categories must match the name of a column header in the mapping file exactly and multiple categories can be list by comma separating them without spaces. The user can also combine columns in the mapping file by separating the categories by "&&" without spaces [default=None]
	-o, `-`-output_dir
		Path to the output directory


**Output:**

This script generates an output folder, which contains several files. To best view the 2D plots, it is recommended that the user views the _pca_2D.html file.


**Default Example:**

If you just want to use the default output, you can supply the principal coordinates file (i.e., resulting file from `principal_coordinates.py <./principal_coordinates.html>`_), where the default coloring will be based on the SampleID as follows:

::

	make_2d_plots.py -i beta_div_coords.txt

**Output Directory Usage:**

If you want to give an specific output directory (e.g. "2d_plots"), use the following code.

::

	make_2d_plots.py -i beta_div_coords.txt -o 2d_plots/

**Mapping File Usage:**

Additionally, the user can supply their mapping file ("-m") and a specific category to color by ("-b") or any combination of categories. When using the -b option, the user can specify the coloring for multiple mapping labels, where each mapping label is separated by a comma, for example: -b 'mapping_column1,mapping_column2'. The user can also combine mapping labels and color by the combined label that is created by inserting an '&&' between the input columns, for example: -b 'mapping_column1&&mapping_column2'.

If the user wants to color by specific mapping labels, they can use the following code:

::

	make_2d_plots.py -i beta_div_coords.txt -m Mapping_file.txt -b 'mapping_column'

If the user would like to color all categories in their metadata mapping file, they can pass 'ALL' to the '-b' option, as follows:

::

	make_2d_plots.py -i beta_div_coords.txt -m Mapping_file.txt -b ALL

**Output Directory Usage:**

If you want to give an specific output directory (e.g. "2d_plots"), use the following code.

::

	make_2d_plots.py -i beta_div_coords.txt -o 2d_plots/

**Combination of Features:**

or use some of the suggestions from above:

::

	make_2d_plots.py -i beta_div_coords.txt -m Mapping_file.txt -b 'mapping_column1,mapping_column1&&mapping_column2'
