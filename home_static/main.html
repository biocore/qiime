			<p>
				QIIME (pronounced "chime") stands for Quantitative Insights Into
Microbial Ecology. QIIME is an open source software package for
comparison and analysis of microbial communities, primarily based on
high-throughput amplicon sequencing data (such as SSU rRNA) generated
on a variety of platforms, but also supporting analysis of other types
of data (such as shotgun metagenomic data). QIIME takes users from
their raw sequencing output through initial analyses such as OTU
picking, taxonomic assignment, and construction of phylogenetic trees
from representative sequences of OTUs, and through downstream
statistical analysis, visualization, and production of
publication-quality graphics. QIIME has been applied to single studies
based on billions of sequences from thousands of samples.
