      "This notebook was designed to run the [QIIME Illumina Overview Tutorial](http://qiime.org/tutorials/illumina_overview_tutorial.html) on the QIIME 1.7.0 Amazon Web Services EC2 instance. You can find the AMI ID on the [QIIME resources page](http://qiime.org/home_static/dataFiles.html). These steps covered here are important for having multiple users working on a single IPython Notebook server, but are a little bit of overkill if you're running this on your own AWS instance. If you're running this on your own instance, you should instead work with the IPython Notebook linked from [here](http://qiime.org/tutorials/illumina_overview_tutorial.html#ipython-notebook)."
