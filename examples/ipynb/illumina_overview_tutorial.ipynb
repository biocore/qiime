      "## Illumina Overview Tutorial: Moving Pictures of the Human Microbiome\n",
      "\n",
      "This tutorial covers a full QIIME workflow using Illumina sequencing data. This tutorial is is intended to be quick to run, and as such, uses only a subset of a full Illumina Genome Analyzer II (GAIIx) run. We'll make use of the ``13_8`` release of the [Greengenes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22134646) reference OTUs. You can always find a link to the latest version of the reference OTUs on the [QIIME resources page](http://qiime.org/home_static/dataFiles.html).\n",

      "The data used in this tutorial is derived from the [Moving Pictures of the Human Microbiome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21624126) study, where two human subjects collected daily samples from four body sites: the tongue, the palm of the left hand, the palm of the right hand, and the gut (via fecal samples obtained by swapping used toilet paper). This data was sequenced across six lanes of an Illumina GAIIx, using the barcoding amplicon sequencing protocol described in [Global patterns of 16S rRNA diversity at a depth of millions of sequences per sample](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20534432). A more recent version of this protocol that can be used with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq can be found [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22402401). \n",

Let us know what you think [here](https://github.com/qiime/qiime/issues/920). For more information on using QIIME with IPython, see [our recent paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23096404).
