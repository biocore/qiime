*identify_chimeric_seqs.py* -- Identify chimeric sequences in input FASTA file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description:**

A FASTA file of sequences, can be screened to remove chimeras (sequences generated due to the PCR amplification of multiple templates or parent sequences). QIIME currently includes a taxonomy-assignment-based approach, blast_fragments, for identifying sequences as chimeric and the ChimeraSlayer algorithm. 

1. Blast_fragments approach: 

The reference sequences (-r) and id-to-taxonomy map (-t) provided are the same format as those provided to `assign_taxonomy.py <./assign_taxonomy.html>`_. The reference sequences are in fasta format, and the id-to-taxonomy map contains tab-separated lines where the first field is a sequence identifier, and the second field is the taxonomy separated by semi-colons (e.g., Archaea;Euryarchaeota;Methanobacteriales;Methanobacterium). The reference collection should be derived from a chimera-checked database (such as the full greengenes database), and filtered to contain only sequences at, for example, a maximum of 97% sequence identity.

2. ChimeraSlayer:

ChimeraSlayer uses BLAST to identify potential chimera parents and computes the optimal branching alignment of the query against two parents.
We suggest to use the pynast aligned representative sequences as input.

3. usearch61:

usearch61 performs both de novo (abundance based) chimera and reference based detection.  Unlike the other two chimera checking software, unclustered sequences should be used as input rather than a representative sequence set, as these sequences need to be clustered to get abundance data.  The results can be taken as the union or intersection of all input sequences not flagged as chimeras.  For details, see: http://drive5.com/usearch/usearch_docs.html

[default: union]
	`-`-usearch61_minh
		Minimum score (h) to be classified as chimera. Increasing this value tends to the number of false positives (and also sensitivity).[default: 0.28]

**Output:**

The result of `identify_chimeric_seqs.py <./identify_chimeric_seqs.html>`_ is a text file that identifies which sequences are chimeric.


**blast_fragments example:**

For each sequence provided as input, the blast_fragments method splits the input sequence into n roughly-equal-sized, non-overlapping fragments, and assigns taxonomy to each fragment against a reference database. The BlastTaxonAssigner (implemented in `assign_taxonomy.py <./assign_taxonomy.html>`_) is used for this. The taxonomies of the fragments are compared with one another (at a default depth of 4), and if contradictory assignments are returned the sequence is identified as chimeric. For example, if an input sequence was split into 3 fragments, and the following taxon assignments were returned:

==========  ==========================================================
fragment1:  Archaea;Euryarchaeota;Methanobacteriales;Methanobacterium
fragment2:  Archaea;Euryarchaeota;Halobacteriales;uncultured
fragment3:  Archaea;Euryarchaeota;Methanobacteriales;Methanobacterium
==========  ==========================================================

The sequence would be considered chimeric at a depth of 3 (Methanobacteriales vs. Halobacteriales), but non-chimeric at a depth of 2 (all Euryarchaeota).

blast_fragments begins with the assumption that a sequence is non-chimeric, and looks for evidence to the contrary. This is important when, for example, no taxonomy assignment can be made because no blast result is returned. If a sequence is split into three fragments, and only one returns a blast hit, that sequence would be considered non-chimeric. This is because there is no evidence (i.e., contradictory blast assignments) for the sequence being chimeric. This script can be run by the following command, where the resulting data is written to the directory "identify_chimeras/" and using default parameters (e.g. chimera detection method ("-m blast_fragments"), number of fragments ("-n 3"), taxonomy depth ("-d 4") and maximum E-value ("-e 1e-30")):

**ChimeraSlayer Example:**

Identify chimeric sequences using the ChimeraSlayer algorithm against a user provided reference data base. The input sequences need to be provided in aligned (Py)Nast format. The reference data base needs to be provided as aligned FASTA (-a). Note that the reference database needs to be the same that was used to build the alignment of the input sequences!

::

	identify_chimeric_seqs.py -m ChimeraSlayer -i repr_set_seqs_aligned.fasta -a ref_seq_set_aligned.fasta -o chimeric_seqs_cs.txt

**usearch61 Example:**

Identify chimeric sequences using the usearch61 algorithm against a user provided reference data base.  The input sequences should be the demultiplexed (not clustered rep set!) sequences, such as those output from `split_libraries.py <./split_libraries.html>`_. The input sequences need to be provided as unaligned fasta in the same orientation as the query sequences.
