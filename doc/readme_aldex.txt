README ALDEx2

ALDEx2 uses Dirichlet Monte-Carlo replicates to estimate technical variance in each feature generated by high throughput sequencing of RNA-seq, tag-sequencing, meta-genomic sequencing, etc. Each MC replicate is center-log ratio transformed following the advice on compositional data of Aitchison (1986) and used for between condition t-tests and fdr rate calculation. The Expected values of p and fdr are reported in the end. This approach is generally useful for compositional data of this type and identifies consistenly different features between conditions. A readme file is included in the doc directory. 

The program currently runs under R v2.15.1 or greater including R 3.0. It requires fdrtool to be installed first. There are only two required inputs

#function 1
x <- aldex( reads, conditions) 
   
reads: an non-negative, integer-only containing ‘data.frame’ that
          has unique names for all rows and columns, where each row is
          a different gene and each column represents a sequencing
          read-count. Rows with 0 reads in each sample will be deleted
          prior to analysis

conditions: a ‘vector’ of length ‘ncol(reads)’ that can be coerced into
          a ‘factor’ representing the conditions of the samples; for
          example: `treatment' and `control', or `normal' and `disease'
 
#function 2
plot.aldex (x, type="MW", test="welches", cutoff=0.1, fdr="qval")

x: an object of class ‘aldex’ produced by the ‘aldex’ function

type: which type of plot is to be produced. MA is a Bland-Altman
          style plot; MW is a difference between to a variance within
          plot as described in the paper; hist is a histogram of p
          values
test: the method of calculating p values, one of welches or wilcox

fdr: the method of characterizing fdr, one of qval (tail area based) or lfdr (density based) false discovery rate method

cutoff: the fdr cutoff, default 0.1

#function 3
y <- summary.aldex(x)

collapses the data structure of x into a single data frame suitable for saving
