==============================================================================

This tutorial is provided as an IPython Notebook. You can view the tutorial `here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/qiime/qiime/master/examples/ipynb/Fungal-ITS-analysis.ipynb>`_, and follow the steps either in your own IPython Notebook, or just using QIIME from the command line.


.. warning::
	
	The links in the above notebook won't work as they represent the output of one specific run of the notebook. You can download the notebook ``.ipynb`` file to run it on your own notebook server from the page linked above (see ``Download notebook`` link on the top-right of that page).
