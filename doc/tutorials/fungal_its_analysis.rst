Fungal ITS analysis tutorial (an IPython Notebook): open-reference OTU picking
==============================================================================

This tutorial is provided as an IPython Notebook. See the `Fungal ITS analysis tutorial IPython Notebook <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/qiime/qiime/raw/1.7.0/examples/ipynb/Fungal-ITS-analysis.ipynb>`_, and follow the steps either in your own IPython Notebook, or just using QIIME from the command line.


.. warning::
	
	The links in the above notebook won't work as they represent the output of one specific run of the notebook. You can download the notebook ``.ipynb`` file to run it on your own notebook server from the page linked above (see ``Download notebook`` link on the top-right of that page).


For more information on using QIIME with IPython, see `our recent paper here <http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ismej2012123a.html>`_. You can find more information on the `IPython Notebook here <http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/htmlnotebook.html>`_, and the `nbviewer tool (which we use to display the notebook) here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/>`_.
