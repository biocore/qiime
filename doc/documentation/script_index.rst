Scripts - Analyses and Parameters
==================================

All QIIME analyses are performed using python (.py) scripts, which must be in a directory in your ``$PATH`` environment variable (see `the install guide <../install/install.html>`_ for more details).

You can run QIIME scripts as::

	align_seqs.py -h

All QIIME scripts can take the ``-h`` option to provide usage information.

An `index of the QIIME scripts is provided here <../scripts/index.html>`_.
